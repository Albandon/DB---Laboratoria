# How to use (in progress):
Run the aplication. You are now in standard user mode from here you are able to add a book, save the changes you made, exit the app or switch to database mode.

Database mode exist purely to allow you further control over the local database (the one on your PC). From here you gain access to modify or erase all of the entered data you also can export or import database from an .csv file

While the standard user mode was made with caution mainly for use by beginers.Which is why it asks you before adding data to further validate it. Database mode no longer has any of such functions, so rememer double check what you are going to do and proced with caution.
